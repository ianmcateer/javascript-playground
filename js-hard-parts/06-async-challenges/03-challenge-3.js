// Write a function everyXsecsForYsecs that will accept three arguments: a function, an interval time in seconds, and a total time in seconds.everyXsecsForYsecs should invoke the given function every X times 1000 milliseconds, but then stop invoking the function after Y times 1000 milliseconds.

// Write function sayHowdy that will log "Howdy" to the console.Then test your everyXsecsForYsecs function by using it to invoke sayHowdy every 1 second for 5 seconds.

// Now, modify your everyXsecsForYsecs function so it does not use setInterval, but still keeps the same functionality.
