// problems with previous approach? Object.create no onne really maybe long winded- can refactor
// its sophisticated but not standard 
// maginc keyword new does it for us
// automates alot

let user1 = new userCreator('will', 3)

// new does two things:
  // creates a new user object
  // returns the new user object
// gives it the label this to the empty object

// but how to add properties?? using this
// but how to add parent functionality?? how do we get that bond??
  // the bond is also automated- but what is it going to refer to??
  // it needs a defauly place
  // functions in js are really just objects

  // could do userCreator.andrew = 3
  // it has no consequences on function
